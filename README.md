# The plotting paradise
#### Video Demo: <url>
#### Description:

We are currently working in a project where we collect data from the equipment and we have to do a lot of copy pasting in a datasheet software to have everything sorted.

The idea of this app is to automate as much as possible, being able to plot the graphs that we can interpret by simply using two .csv files as input. No more copy + paste + mouse dragging around. Just file input and fancy plotting.

In order to do this, we created an user interface (tkinter), treated the data as much as we could (pandas, numpy and scipy) and plotted everything nicely (matplotlib).
